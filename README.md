# Replication-Package-Final-Project
## Instructions 
To access and utilize the script, open the "final_project_script.R" file, which contains the code for my findings. To access the dataset, open the "Full dataset; New Girl - Sheet1 (4).csv" file. 

## **Data** 
The data used for the analyses was gathering information from scenes in episodes of the T.V. series New Girl. The question being asked was if New Girl, the comedy T.V. show, showed script difference with women compared to men, specifically the comedic aspect. Each unit of analysis was three scenes from one episode of each season. The type of sampling strategy that was used was simple random sampling. 
I gathered the data bt starting from the first season and randomly selecting an episode, then randomly selecting three scenes in the episode and analyze the scene length with women in seconds, what gender was the majority talking, how many jokes were made, how funny the scene was, and the style of humor. 

## **Operationalization**
The concept of scene length with women compared to men, in the selected scenes of selected episodes, was operationalized by using a quantitative coding scheme was timing the the appearance of women in the scene in seconds. Accumalating to a certain number of seconds per scene. 

The concept of jokes that were made in the scene as a whole to relate to the bigger picture in my analysis, was operationalized by using a quantitative coding scheme by counting, in whole numbers, the amount of jokes I found per scene. 

The concept of funniness relating to the bigger picture of gender dynamics in comedic series was operationalized by using a quantitative coding scheme scale from 1-10 rated funniness. 1 being not funny, 2 rated not really funny, 3 being a little more funny, 4, still not average funny, 5, average funny, 6, slightly more than average funny, 7, pretty funny, 8, really funny, 9, a lot  funny, and lastly 10 being a great funny. 

The concept of who is talking most in the scene, related to gender dynamics in the comedy show, is a qualitative coding scheme operationalized by stating "men" which means that men did more of the talking in the scene. And "women" which means women did more of the talking. And "both" which means it's a very close balance between the two, men and women, who talked were scripted to talk the most in the scenes of the episodes analyzed. 

The concept of style of humor, related to what style of humor is represented in the scene, is a qualitative coding scheme operationalized by determining which 4 of the styles of humor is written in the script. First one being Affiliative humor, which is defined by telling jokes about things that everyone would find funny. The second style of humor being self-enhancing humor a joke made when something bad happens to oneself and a joke is made to find humor in the situation. third humor category being self-defeating humor which is putting oneself down in an aggressive or "poor me" way. And the last category, aggressive humor, which involves put-downs or insults targeted towards individuals. Each scene is categorized under one of the four humors.
